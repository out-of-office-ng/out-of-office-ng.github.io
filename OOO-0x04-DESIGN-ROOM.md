## 0. The rules of this room (read first)

1. **Sign everything.** Every log entry, every critique, every decision
   proposal ends with your tag on its own line: `--claude`, `--agy` or
   `--codex`. Also put the tag in the body of **every git commit** you make
   (e.g. a last line `--codex`). This is how the owner audits who did what.
   Unsigned work doesn't count as having been discussed.
2. **Critique hard, but only with evidence.** We're here to get the best
   result, not to win arguments or talk each other down. Every critique must
   carry one of these labels:
   - `[FACT]`: verifiable, and say how you checked it (a measured contrast
     ratio, a `file:line`, a build log, a Lighthouse number, a spec clause
     like "WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.3").
   - `[PRACTICE]`: an established best practice, and name the source (MDN,
     WAI-ARIA APG, web.dev, library docs).
   - `[OPINION]`: taste or judgement. That's allowed, but it's weighed below
     facts, and you should say what evidence would change your mind.

   If you disagree, propose an alternative and state its cost. "This is
   bad" without an alternative isn't a critique.
3. **Don't silently undo another agent's work.** Raise it in the log first,
   with evidence. If the owner or the other agents agree, then change it.
4. **Claims about the code must be checked against the code.** Never
   describe a file you haven't opened. If you ran something, say so. If you
   didn't, say "not verified".
5. **Honesty in content.** Don't invent stats, testimonials, photos, dates
   or prices and present them as real. Stock photos are placeholders until
   they're replaced. Event facts come only from the owner (section 2).
6. **Git safety.**
   - Work on branches cut from `v2`, named `v2-<agent>-<topic>` (e.g.
     `v2-codex-tokens`).
   - **Never push to `main`.** Pushing to `main` deploys the live site
     (GitHub Pages) and syncs the owner's portfolio repo.
   - Never touch the `v1` branch or the `v1.0` tag: they're the frozen
     archive served live at `/v1/`.
   - No force-pushes and no history rewrites on shared branches.
   - Merging into `v2` needs a green build and a signed log entry.
7. **Quality bar for merging into `v2`.**
   - `npm run build` passes with **zero** Svelte/Vite warnings. `v2`
     currently builds clean, so keep it that way.
   - You checked it in a real browser and noted how (screenshot,
     Playwright script, manual).
   - Keyboard and screen reader reachability are kept.
   - `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected.
   - Works at 390px wide with no horizontal page scroll.
8. **Scratch files.** Owner notes and throwaway material live in `.dump/`
   (gitignored). Read them for background, but this file is the source of
   truth. If they conflict, this file wins; if this file is wrong, fix it
   here with a signed log entry.
9. **Keep the current site lean.** Read `OOO-0x04-LEAN-SCOPE.md` before
   changing the page structure or restoring an old component. The owner
   directed a beach-party invitation, not a SaaS interface. Parked ideas
   need a signed proposal and an explicit owner decision before returning.

## 1. What Out of Office is

**Out of Office** is a Lagos hangout series. The brand is an auto-reply for
real life: *"I am currently away from emails, responsibilities, and Lagos
stress. I will return when my soul battery is charged."*

It isn't a luxury holiday. It's a small, temporary rebellion against Lagos
pressure: traffic, hustle culture, the economy, relentless notifications,
"when are you getting married?". People come for music, art, board games,
shared snacks, sunsets, and conversations you still remember on Monday. No
hierarchy, strangers becoming friends.

**The central metaphor: leaving yellow Lagos, entering blue Lagos.**
- *Yellow Lagos*: danfo buses, chaos-yellow `#FFC72C`, traffic red,
  concrete grey, notification noise.
- *Blue Lagos*: Tarkwa Bay, reached by a ~15-minute boat ride from the
  Marina jetty. Ocean, sand, slower time.

The original concept notes (`concept.txt`, tracked in the repo) describe the
website as a journey: a desktop drowning in Slack/WhatsApp/calendar popups →
"OUT OF OFFICE activated" → everything fades → ocean sound → a boat crosses →
you arrive at Tarkwa Bay. Note that `concept.txt` explicitly says *"Instead
of a Rubik cube"*. The cube that later became the v1 hero was a detour from
that original idea.

**Voice:** auto-reply language, dry Lagos humour, warm, never corporate.
Examples already on the site: "Gone to touch grass. Back soon." · "Auto
replies enabled. Stress disabled." · "Your ticket out of yellow Lagos."

**Visual world:** zine/print. Boarding passes, passport stamps, polaroids,
marker script, paper grain, postcards. Tactile and analog. We deliberately
removed SaaS furniture (toasts, ⌘K palette, dark-mode toggle, audio mixer),
because a site about escaping screens shouldn't look like a dashboard.

## 2. The event we're selling: OOO 0x04 (November 2026)

| # | Name | Where | When | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x01 | The Post-NYSC Hangout | Tarkwa Bay Beach | Apr 11, 2025 · 12pm till daybreak | done |
| 0x02 | Open Canvas | Jaekel House Garden | May 30, 2025 | done |
| 0x03 | Release and Unwind | Tarkwa Bay Beach | Aug 15–16, 2026 · overnight beach camp | done |
| **0x04** | **TBA** | **TBA** | **November 2026, exact date TBA** | **up next: this site's job** |

Rules for 0x04 content:
- The number is **0x04** / "No. 04". Some owner notes still say "No. 03".
  That's stale, so correct it wherever you see it.
- Say "November" but **no exact day** until the owner gives one.
  `EVENT_DATE` in `src/App.svelte` switches the countdown on when it's set.
- Venue, tiers and prices for 0x04 are **not known yet**.
- ⚠️ **Open blocker:** the live Paystack checkout (live key) still sells
  0x03's tiers (₦15,000 Explorer / ₦20,000 Retreat, with Tarkwa Bay tent
  perks). They're only relabelled "0x04 · Date TBA" on `v2`. **Nobody ships
  v2 until the owner decides:** real 0x04 tiers, a free waitlist, or
  purchases turned off.

---

## 3. The codebase: facts as of `v2` @ `8795bf5`

**Stack:**
- Svelte 5 (`^5.56`) with legacy `export let` syntax throughout. Keep to
  it; don't mix in runes piecemeal.
- Vite 8, `three@^0.185.1`.
- Hash routing (`#/`, `#/about`, `#/trail`), with no router library.
- Fonts are self-hosted in `public/fonts/`: Fraunces, Space Grotesk,
  Fredoka, Bungee, Permanent Marker, Back Wild. Don't add Google Fonts
  links.

**Deploy:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`: every push to `main` builds the
  root site **and** builds the `v1` branch into `/v1/`.
- The live site is https://out-of-office-ng.github.io/, and v1 is archived
  at https://out-of-office-ng.github.io/v1/.
- A second workflow syncs `main` into the owner's portfolio repo under
  `/out-of-office/`.

**Branches:**

| Branch | What it is |
|---|---|
| `main` | Live site = v1 (Paystack, countdown, cube hero) plus the `/v1/` workflow |
| `v1` / tag `v1.0` | Frozen v1 archive |
| `v2` | The redesign. **All our work branches from here.** |
| `overhaul` | Old work-in-progress branch, already merged into `v2` except its audio |
| `origin/claude/kind-noether-fd8k8v` | Unmerged ticket-flow polish (shared `tickets.js`, clearer tier copy). Useful once 0x04 tiers exist. |

**What `v2` already did** (see `TASKS.md` → P5):
- **Removed:** CommandPalette, the toast system, AudioControlDeck,
  ScrollToTop, dark mode/`theme.js`, and the cube's own mini-modal.
- **Feedback is inline:** field errors, "Copied ✓".
- **Header has 4 controls:** brand · ONLINE/AWAY · mute · OOO PASS →.
- **`src/lib/calm.js`:** one 0..1 value = max(page scroll, AWAY toggle).
  Toggling AWAY bursts the chaos popups, drains the notification pill and
  the stress meter, solves the cube, flips `MorphText` eyebrows to
  handwriting, and crossfades the audio.
- **0x03 is marked done** on the trail and timeline; 0x04 is "up next".
- **The hero** shows "OOO 0x04 · Up next" with a "Date TBA" chip.
- **The Lagos Survival Stats easter egg** is a click on the stress meter.
  The cube's 10-click easter egg opens the one auto-reply generator.
- **From `overhaul`:** the FeaturedShowcase 3D carousel (**placeholder
  content**), tappable boat/danfo, full-bleed EventTrail cards, and a "v1 →"
  link on `#/about`.
- The build has zero warnings.

**Component map (`src/lib/`):**

| Group | Components |
|---|---|
| Hero (v1-era) | `RotatingCube` (Three.js 27-cubie, scroll-solves), `ChaosLayer` (10 popup cards), `DanfoBus`, `Boat` (SVG), `StressMeter`, `ZineDecorations`, `FooterBar` |
| Page sections | `Postcard`, `EscapeMetrics`, `Community` (polaroids, currently **Pexels stock photos**), `MemoryTimeline` (stamps), `FeaturedShowcase`, `Playlist`, `Tickets` (boarding pass), `ScheduleFAQ` |
| Overlays | `RsvpDrawer` (3-step Paystack claim), `OooGeneratorModal` |
| Routes | `AboutEvent` + `AsciiFire` (`#/about`, a deliberately dark bonfire page), `EventTrail` (`#/trail`) |
| Plumbing | `BootSequence` (plays once per session; ends with a rising wave), `AmbientSound` + `ambientSound.js` (file-based audio + the `muted` store), `MorphText` (corporate→handwritten eyebrows), `ScrollReveal`, `scrollProgress.js`, `motion.js` |

**Assets:**
- Real event flyers and postcards are in `docs/brand-reference/`.
- **There are no real event photos in the repo yet.** The owner needs to
  supply them.
- `public/audio/beach-waves.m4a` is 181 MB, untracked and gitignored.
  Never commit it: GitHub rejects files over 100 MB.

## 4. Where we're going: "The Crossing" (--claude's proposal, open for critique)

Two notes from another AI (now in `.dump/`) explored replacing the hero with
a WebGL water scene, **"The shallows"** (`deepseek_1.html` in the repo root,
untracked, ~1,700 lines, Three.js). Its first idea put the water in the
hero. Its second moved the water to the end of the page as the destination,
reasoning that the water in frame one skips the journey `concept.txt`
describes. I agree with the move to the end. Below is my synthesis, which
isn't the same as either note.

**Big idea:** the page is the 15-minute boat ride. You start on dry paper
land at the jetty, and each section is a stretch of the crossing. The
boarding pass is the last thing on land, and then you're in the water.
Scroll is the journey, and the shallows are the arrival.

| # | Stretch | Section | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | The noise | `BootSequence` (once per session) | Keep. This is where "Scene 1: the notification desktop" from `concept.txt` lives: a short chaos → "auto-reply activated" beat. |
| 1 | The jetty | New **paper hero**: "OUT *of* OFFICE", "No. 04 · November", tagline, "Date TBA" chip, CTA → boarding pass | Plain HTML/CSS, which makes it the LCP element. No WebGL at the top. A small hint that there's water at the end (e.g. "The shallows wait at the end ↓"). |
| 2 | Leaving | The auto reply (`EscapeMetrics`) | Stats must be obviously playful or real (rule 5). |
| 3 | Looking back | **Previous escapes**: one carousel, **real photos from 0x01–0x03 only** | Merge `FeaturedShowcase` and the proposed "BeachCarousel" into one component. Delete the other. |
| 4 | Stamps | `MemoryTimeline` (0x01–0x03 done, 0x04 up next) | Already correct on `v2`. |
| 5 | Soundtrack | `Playlist` | Keep. |
| 6 | Last thing on land | `Tickets` (boarding pass) → `RsvpDrawer` | Waits on the Paystack decision (section 2). |
| 7 | Arrival | **`ShallowsScene`**: full viewport, lazy-mounted, intro card "Out of office / No. 04 · The shallows." plus a secondary "Claim your pass" CTA | The payoff. Closing line: "Leaving yellow Lagos. Entering blue Lagos." |
| — | Always | Header (brand · status · mute · OOO PASS →) | OOO PASS stays the always-reachable conversion path. The design must not depend on people reaching the bottom of the page. |

**What happens to the v1-era hero pieces** (proposal): `RotatingCube`
(hero use), `ChaosLayer`, `DanfoBus`, the SVG `Boat`, `StressMeter`, the
cube companion, the "Activated" section, and the 150vh scroll pin all leave
the hero. The shallows takes over their jobs:
- The water's wave envelope ("restless sets, then still lulls") replaces
  the stress meter, without any extra UI.
- The pink paper boat in the water replaces the SVG boat.
- Arriving at the water is the "activated" moment.

**The ONLINE/AWAY toggle becomes the "chaos rain" (from the owner's
notes):**
- The default is **AWAY**: the site is calm, because you're out of office.
- Flipping to **ONLINE** rains ~6 notification cards (WhatsApp from the
  boss, Slack incident, compliance email, 15-minute sync, GTBank debit
  alert, low battery) over whatever you're looking at.
- Clicking a card bursts it, and flipping back to AWAY bursts them all.
- **If you leave it ONLINE for ~8 s, the site mutes the chaos itself and
  flips back to AWAY**, with the status note "Auto-reply re-enabled." The
  auto-reply always wins.
- Chaos yellow and red then appear **only** inside this rain, so the palette
  itself tells the story.
- `ChaosLayer`'s card content and burst animation can be reused. `calm.js`
  either shrinks to the scroll-driven `MorphText` progress or goes entirely;
  argue it out in the log.

**Palette: shift the whole site to the water palette, with the contrast
failures fixed.** The water's colours become the site's tokens in
`src/app.css`. These are measured with WCAG relative luminance
`[FACT computed by --claude]`:

| Token (proposed) | Value | On paper `#f2f0e9` | Allowed use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bg` paper | `#f2f0e9` | — | page |
| `--ink` deep-water ink | `#243e3c` | 10.07:1 ✅ | all text |
| `--deep` | `#376a65` | 5.40:1 ✅ | text, buttons (paper text on it: 5.61:1 ✅) |
| `--seafoam` | `#7aaea8` | **2.18:1 ❌** | **fills and decoration only, never text** |
| `--boat` pink | `#d45a82` | 3.30:1 | large text (≥24px, or ≥18.66px bold) and decoration only |
| muted ink | `#243e3c` at ≥0.75 alpha (`#586a67`) | 5.01:1 ✅ | secondary text. **0.62 alpha measures 3.53:1 and fails** |

For comparison, today's `--blue` `#00bfff` on cream measures 1.93:1, so the
current eyebrows already fail SC 1.4.3. The proposed notes used seafoam
eyebrow text; that's rejected on contrast.

**Porting "The shallows" (`deepseek_1.html` → `src/lib/ShallowsScene.svelte`):**

What to keep in the scene:
- **The layer/refraction composite.** The final pass renders only sky and
  water; boat, fish and rocks come through the refraction render target,
  composited by a depth test in the water shader. **Don't "fix" this by
  adding objects to the visible layer.**
- The procedural WebAudio ocean, synced to the surf fronts. It replaces
  file-based beach audio completely.
- The safeguards: dynamic resolution with a pixel budget, pausing on
  `visibilitychange` and `IntersectionObserver`, WebGL context-loss
  handling, `pagehide`/bfcache disposal, and reduced-motion (paused by
  default, but input still renders single frames).

Required changes:
1. **Remove the custom wheel zoom.** It calls `preventDefault` on `wheel`,
   which stops page scrolling while the cursor is over a full-viewport
   section. Orbit is drag-only.
2. **Touch.** `[FACT]` Three's `OrbitControls.connect()` sets
   `domElement.style.touchAction = 'none'`
   (`node_modules/three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js:508`, r185),
   so you **must set `touch-action: pan-y` after creating the controls**.
   Otherwise the page can't be scrolled past the scene on phones.
   Horizontal drag orbits, vertical swipe scrolls, and a tap makes a
   ripple.
3. **Bundle Three locally.** Drop the importmap and the unpkg
   `three@0.160.0`; use `import * as THREE from 'three'` (the repo is on
   r185, which is already a shared `three-vendor` chunk). The scene patches
   shader chunks (`colorspace_fragment`, `tonemapping_fragment`), so
   **verify it renders on r185**. That's not verified yet.
4. **Remove the demo UI:** the toolbar, the quality picker (quality stays
   on `auto`), `body[data-mode]`, `#preview-copy`, and `hideIntroOnce`. The
   intro card stays, because it holds a CTA. Only the hint line fades.
5. **Sound follows the shared `muted` store** in `ambientSound.js`. The
   `AudioContext` only starts after a user gesture, and only while the
   scene is in view.
6. **Mount lazily:** dynamic `import()` when the section comes within ~1
   viewport (`IntersectionObserver` with a `rootMargin`). The section's CSS
   gradient (`#dce7df → #7aaea8 → #376a65`) is both the loading state and
   the no-WebGL fallback. A "The water is loading…" line replaces
   `#notice`.
7. **Fonts:** Georgia → Fraunces, system-ui → Space Grotesk. The canvas is
   `aria-hidden`, and the intro card carries the real text.
8. **Keep only one WebGL scene running at a time.** If the cube survives
   anywhere, it must stop rendering while the shallows are on screen.

**The cube: open question, and --claude's lean.** A docked 10-click cube
companion would keep a second WebGL renderer alive on every page. My lean:
retire the cube from default view and **move the 10-click egg to the pink
paper boat** in the shallows (tap it 10 times → the auto-reply generator).
The boat is the auto-reply in physical form. The risk is that taps also make
ripples; the boat needs hit-testing so it doesn't double-fire. Critique
welcome.

**Audio:**
- Delete `AmbientSound.svelte`'s file-based beds and any need for
  `public/audio/`.
- **Don't autoplay city noise.** `[PRACTICE]` Browsers block audio
  autoplay without a user gesture (MDN "Autoplay guide"), and ambient
  street noise on a calm-brand site is questionable in its own right.
- The mute button stays, as the single control shared with the scene.

## 5. Open decisions (owner decides, agents argue with evidence)

| ID | Question | Options | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | 0x04 tickets | real tiers / free waitlist / off | **DECIDED by owner 2026-09-24: C (off) now → B (waitlist) → A (real tiers)**. C is live, see log |
| D2 | Water placement | end-of-page destination (proposed) / hero / whole page | leaning end, per owner notes |
| D3 | Palette | site-wide water palette with the contrast fixes above (proposed) / hero only | leaning site-wide |
| D4 | The cube | retire + boat egg (--claude lean) / docked companion / remove fully | open |
| D5 | Default status | AWAY with chaos rain on ONLINE (proposed) / keep today's ONLINE→AWAY calm | leaning AWAY + rain |
| D6 | Carousel | one "Previous escapes" component: port the owner's BeachCarousel logic vs keep `FeaturedShowcase` | open, needs a code review from both sides |
| D7 | Real photos | owner to supply 0x01–0x03 photos; stock stays placeholder only | waiting on owner |
| D8 | `EscapeMetrics` / Survival Stats numbers | label them clearly as jokes / replace with real numbers / cut | open |

---

## 6. Workstreams (proposed split; the owner may reassign)

Claim a stream by signing a log entry. Each stream lands as its own branch
from `v2`.

- **A · Foundation (proposed: --codex)**
  - Token swap in `app.css` with contrast-checked values (section 4 table).
  - Restructure `App.svelte` into the Crossing order.
  - The new paper hero.
  - Remove the orphaned hero components (per D4/D5).
  - Delete dead code.
  - Keep BootSequence.
- **B · The shallows (proposed: --claude)**
  - Port `ShallowsScene.svelte` per the 8 required changes.
  - Lazy mount, fallback and loading state.
  - Audio on the `muted` store.
  - Test the performance and mobile touch behaviour.
- **C · Interactions & content (proposed: --agy)**
  - Chaos rain + the status toggle rework.
  - Carousel consolidation (D6).
  - Boat or cube easter egg (D4).
  - 0x04 copy pass (No. 04, November).
  - Ticket flow once D1 is decided (consider `kind-noether`'s `tickets.js`).

Streams touch each other at `App.svelte`, `app.css` and `HeaderBar.svelte`.
**Stream A owns `App.svelte` structure and `app.css` tokens.** The others
make small, clearly signed edits there, or ask A.

**Definition of done for the whole redesign:**
- Zero-warning build.
- Lighthouse run on mobile with numbers posted in the log (no LCP
  regression from WebGL).
- Keyboard-only walkthrough of the whole page.
- Reduced-motion walkthrough.
- 390px and 1440px screenshots.
- The Paystack decision implemented.
- `TASKS.md` updated.
- The owner approves before anything goes to `main`.

---

## 7. What's in `.dump/` (background only, gitignored)

- `suggestion-not-compulsory.txt`: owner-shared AI notes. Answers the four
  earlier decisions (site-wide palette, chaos rain, water at the end,
  carousel as "Previous escapes"). Includes a full HTML preview of that
  direction, with CSS stand-in water and the owner's carousel logic.
- `ideas`: the first AI review of "The shallows". Water in the hero, a list
  of code strengths, and the port deltas. Superseded by the water-at-the-end
  direction.
- `changes-to-be-iscarded-after.txt` / `commit_instructions.txt`: the v2
  strip-down spec. It's already implemented on `v2`, and the two files are
  near-identical.
- In the repo root, still untracked: `deepseek_1.html` (the shallows
  source, the one to port) and `deepseek_2.html` (an earlier "Take a
  moment" variant: cream boat, no wave sets, generic copy; not chosen).

## 8. Log

Append new entries at the bottom, newest last. Format:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM · <topic> · <PROPOSAL | CRITIQUE | DECISION-REQUEST | DONE | QUESTION>
<body with [FACT]/[PRACTICE]/[OPINION] labels where you make claims>
--<agent>
```

### 2026-09-24 · Room opened · PROPOSAL
I opened this room and wrote sections 1–7 from the owner's notes and from
reading the code on `v2` @ `8795bf5`.

- The contrast ratios in section 4 were computed with the WCAG 2.x relative
  luminance formula.
- The `OrbitControls` touch-action line was read from the installed r185
  source.
- The shallows port on r185 has **not** been test-rendered yet.
- "The Crossing" (section 4) is my proposal, not a decision. I'd most like
  challenges on D4 (moving the easter egg to the boat) and on whether the
  chaos-rain auto-mute timing (8 s) is right.

I'm proposing to take stream B.
--claude

### 2026-09-24 13:00 · Stream C · PROPOSAL
I've read the brief and will take Stream C (Interactions & content). I'm creating the branch `v2-agy-interactions` from `v2` to begin work on the chaos rain, carousel consolidation, easter egg porting, and 0x04 copy pass.

Regarding D4 (moving the easter egg to the boat), `[OPINION]` it's a solid conceptual fit for the "auto-reply in physical form". I'll investigate hit-testing on the boat to ensure it doesn't conflict with ripples. 
For D5, `[OPINION]` AWAY as default with chaos rain on ONLINE is a great reversal of the v1 logic. The 8-second auto-mute is a good starting point and can be adjusted if it feels too long/short in practice.
--agy

### 2026-09-24 · Stream B claimed · PROPOSAL
Taking stream B (the shallows port). I'm working on branch
`v2-claude-shallows` in a separate git worktree
(`../ooo-claude-shallows`), so I never switch the branch under anyone
sharing this checkout. I suggest --agy and --codex do the same
(`git worktree add ../ooo-<agent>-<topic> -b v2-<agent>-<topic> v2`).

Scope:
- `src/lib/ShallowsScene.svelte` plus a thin `src/lib/Shallows.svelte`
  section wrapper (lazy mount, fallback, intro card).
- A temporary mount at the end of `App.svelte` so it can be tested.
  **Stream A owns final placement.**

I won't touch `app.css` tokens or the hero.
--claude

### 2026-09-24 · Stream A foundation · DONE
[FACT] Added PaperHero and portable water tokens, restructured App into the
Crossing order, and retired cube/companion/stress meter/file audio from the
home composition. Original component files and hash routes are retained.
The boarding pass is followed by the reserved Stream B arrival slot.
[FACT] `npm run build` passes without Svelte warnings; Vite reports a
plugin-timing advisory. This is a work-branch checkpoint, not a v2 merge.
Responsive and keyboard checks continue with the other streams integrated.
### 2026-09-24 · Select the shallows and start integration · PROPOSAL
[OPINION] Choose `deepseek_1.html`: its pink paper boat, surf fronts and
wave-set envelope fit the Crossing's arrival better than the generic
"Take a moment" variant. An owner preference after side-by-side rendering
would change this choice. The owner asked Codex to decide and get work moving.
[FACT] Both HTML files were read; variant 1 implements `computeWaveEnvelope`,
layer-separated refraction and procedural audio. Its wheel handler prevents
page scrolling, and its demo UI queries the global document.
Start an additive, reviewable arrival integration on `v2-codex-shallows`:
local Three imports, component-owned lifecycle, lazy mount, shared mute,
scroll-safe controls, and gradient fallback. Preserve the other components
and route ownership. Suspend cube mounts while the arrival is visible;
unmount the old file-audio component in favour of the procedural ocean.
This is the first slice, not a claim that the entire redesign is finished.
D1 remains open and blocks deployment. No files will be deleted.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Stream A coordination · PROPOSAL
[FACT] Claude's Stream B claim appeared during my initial port work.
I am moving to Stream A in `../ooo-codex-foundation`, branch
`v2-codex-foundation`, to avoid duplicating his scene. My preliminary port
is archived in `.dump/shallows-review/`; only my mount/token edits are
being backed out of this shared checkout. Agy's November copy is preserved.
I will own `App.svelte`, additive `app.css` tokens, `tokens.css`, and a
`PaperHero.svelte`. No component files will be deleted. The existing routes
and content remain; the cube, companion and stress meter leave the home
composition. Claude: please expose your wrapper as `Shallows.svelte` with
`onOpenDrawer` and `onOpenOooGen` callbacks; I will integrate that wrapper
when available. Agy: your HeaderBar/status and content edits stay yours.

--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Stream A browser verification and handoff · DONE
[FACT] `v2-codex-foundation` in `../ooo-codex-foundation` contains the paper
hero, water palette, Crossing composition and merged Stream C commit
`ce449be`. Production preview: http://127.0.0.1:5195/ (dev: 5175).
[FACT] Playwright/Chromium checked widths 320, 375, 390, 414, 768 and 1440:
root scrollWidth equals viewport at every width; no canvas is mounted.
Reduced-motion keyboard activation of the hero CTA reaches Tickets with a
visible focus ring. About and Trail render. No page errors were captured.
Screenshots inspected: `.dump/foundation/hero-1440.png` and `hero-390.png`
in the foundation worktree. An intermediate dev test caught a stale Vite
merge-conflict overlay; final checks ran against the built production preview.
[FACT] Build succeeds without Svelte warnings. Vite's plugin-timing advisory
remains, so this is not represented as the room's strict zero-warning v2
release gate. Computed paper contrast: ink 10.07:1, deep 5.40:1, muted 5.01:1,
and dark pink text 6.19:1.
Stream B integration remains deliberately reserved after Tickets. Claude's
active scene files were not copied or overwritten. The optional EVENT_DATE
countdown hook remains in App and is passed to PaperHero. No main/v2 merge,
deployment, Lighthouse score or full-site accessibility certification claimed.
Existing ticket policy, photos and playful-stat decisions remain open.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Stream A implementation available · PROPOSAL
[FACT] Foundation implemented in `../ooo-codex-foundation` on
`v2-codex-foundation`: PaperHero, existing-token palette overrides, Crossing
section order, no mounted cube/companion/stress meter/file audio, and a
reserved arrival slot immediately after Tickets. No component files deleted.
The dev preview is on port 5175. I will consume the committed Stream C
changes and Stream B wrapper after my foundation commit. Please keep
`App.svelte` structural changes in your worktree minimal for integration.
[FACT] Build succeeds; Vite emitted a plugin-timing advisory (no Svelte
warnings). Responsive browser checks are in progress.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Integrated preview branch · DONE
[FACT] Stream B's committed `Shallows.svelte` and scene module from
`v2-claude-shallows` @ `c425201` now mount after Tickets on
`v2-codex-foundation`; the old placeholder is gone. Stream C's design-audit
fixes from `8093f0b` are merged. The scene's boat egg opens the existing
auto-reply generator through App's callback.
[FACT] `npm run build` passes without Svelte warnings. Production-preview
Playwright at 390 and 1440 found one canvas in the arrival section, no
horizontal page overflow and no page or console errors. Screenshots at
`.dump/foundation/integrated-390.png` and `integrated-1440.png` were captured.
This branch is a review preview. D1 ticket policy still blocks shipping.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Root preview switched on · DONE
[FACT] The shared root checkout is now `v2-codex-preview` at `e933495`,
combining the paper Crossing, Stream C interactions and Stream B's live
shallows. `http://127.0.0.1:5180/` is running from this checkout.
A Chromium check on the root dev server found the new hero and, after lazy
loading, one water canvas with no page or console errors. At 390px the
page had no horizontal overflow. This branch is for review; `v2` and
`main` were not changed.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Background preview on arrival · PROPOSAL
[FACT] The root preview currently presents the water only in explore mode
(`src/lib/shallows/createShallows.js:49`), although `deepseek_1.html` has a
separate Background preview control and a calmer camera/wave treatment. The
owner said they would have preferred that feature in the first version.
[OPINION] Add a two-state arrival: background preview first, then optional
exploration. This shows how the water works behind real OOO copy while keeping
it as the end-of-page payoff. A direct hero link makes it easy to review. I
would change the default if visitors consistently choose Explore before
reading the arrival, or if the copy obscures the scene on mobile.
I will edit `src/lib/Shallows.svelte`, `src/lib/shallows/createShallows.js`,
`src/lib/PaperHero.svelte` and this log. The scene's refraction composite and
checkout flow are untouched.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Background preview and current design assessment · DONE
[FACT] The live preview now starts the shallows in Background preview mode,
with real OOO copy over the calmer scene. Explore water enables orbit, tap
ripples and keyboard scene focus. The hero's "Preview the shallows" link
jumps to the arrival. This restores the useful part of `deepseek_1.html`'s
preview mode without bringing its demo toolbar into the site.
[FACT] `npm run build` passes without Svelte warnings. Playwright at 390 and
1440 checked one canvas, no horizontal overflow or page errors, both mode
transitions, canvas accessibility state, hero navigation, and the boarding
pass drawer. Keyboard tabbing shows a visible focus ring on the mode control.
Screenshots: `.dump/review/background-390.png`, `background-1440.png`,
`explore-390.png`, `explore-1440.png`.
[OPINION] The paper hero and water arrival now give the page a clear opening
and payoff. The preview-first choice lets the water support the brand copy;
if observation shows visitors skipping directly to Explore, switch the
default. Cost: Preview softens waves and hides direct canvas interaction
until the visitor opts in.
[FACT] `EscapeMetrics.svelte:10-14` renders 87 emails, 62% stress reduction
and 100% battery charge without a supplied measurement. Treat them as
explicit jokes or remove them; losing the numbers reduces visual variety.
[FACT] `FeaturedShowcase.svelte:18-27` uses repeated placeholder cards and
no event photos. Replace them with owner-supplied event photos when available;
using flyers now would document the events but not show the community.
[FACT] `Tickets.svelte:12-20,60` and `RsvpDrawer.svelte:30-46` still expose
0x03 prices/perks and Tarkwa Bay assumptions for 0x04. D1 must be resolved
before shipping; disabling purchases until the owner decides would avoid
selling incorrect passes but would pause conversion.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Carousel failure and repair · CRITIQUE
[FACT] Chromium/Playwright on `v2-codex-preview` found five focusable
Details buttons inside `aria-hidden` carousel cards
(`src/lib/FeaturedShowcase.svelte:226-256`). The active dot changed while
`.card.front` remained the first event after Next on 390px; screenshots in
`.dump/audit/carousel-390-*.png` show the card covering its heading. On
1440px, Playwright could not click Next because rotating cards intercepted
the button for 30 seconds. The timer at lines 83-89 advances without a
visible pause control, and Details calls a browser `alert()` at line 147.
[OPINION] Replace the 3D ring in the same component with a manual archival
carousel: one event at a time, typed event facts, no autoplay, accessible
previous/next/selector buttons and a route link. This costs the 3D spectacle
but removes the overlap and focus bugs while fitting the print voice. The
owner explicitly asked to audit and fix the carousel, so this change is in
scope. Do not use the repo flyers as 0x01/0x02 carousel images: inspected
files contain dates/prices that conflict with the design-room facts.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · False 0x04 checkout and schedule · CRITIQUE
[FACT] `Tickets.svelte:12-20,60,71-128` currently offers ₦15,000 and
₦20,000 tiers, fixes 0x04 at Tarkwa Bay/Marina, and claims confirmed tent
perks. `RsvpDrawer.svelte:30-100` can open live Paystack for those tiers or
issue a simulated paid pass without Paystack. `ScheduleFAQ.svelte:1-45`
presents an invented timed itinerary, transport and venue policies. Section
2 of this room confirms only November 2026 and No. 04; D1 remains open.
[PRACTICE] The Hallmark honest-copy rule forbids unsupported prices,
metrics and event facts. Presenting a paid pass with unknown event details
could mislead visitors. On this preview branch, turn purchases off and show
the confirmed month plus TBA date/venue/price. Retain the boarding-pass
metaphor and an information drawer. Cost: no checkout conversion until the
owner chooses 0x04 tiers or a waitlist. This is reversible and avoids making
D1 implicitly through invented ticket details.
[FACT] `EscapeMetrics.svelte:10-14` renders exact counts/percentages that
were not supplied by the owner. Replace the number-led tiles with the
actual auto-reply sentence and non-numeric, clearly playful activities.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Site error audit and repair · DONE
[FACT] `main` was changed concurrently during this audit. Its merged `Tickets.svelte` had an unclosed `{#if salesOpen}` and `npm run build` failed at line 133. I worked in the separate `v2-codex-audit` worktree and brought the closed-sales guard from `main` into that branch. I did not edit or push `main`.
[FACT] The carousel repair in `FeaturedShowcase.svelte` now shows one archived event per view, with manual previous/next/selector controls, no auto-advance and no hidden focusable cards. Chromium/Playwright at 320, 390 and 1440px cycled 0x01, 0x02 and 0x03 correctly, with no overflow.
[FACT] `Tickets.svelte` now compiles and marks its pass as a preview. It shows only the confirmed OOO 0x04 month and TBA date, venue, passes and prices. `RsvpDrawer.svelte` opens an informational sheet while sales are closed. The old offline fallback cannot issue a simulated paid pass when payment is unavailable. `ScheduleFAQ.svelte` no longer asserts an unannounced itinerary or transport policy. `EscapeMetrics.svelte` no longer presents unsupported numeric results.
[FACT] `Community.svelte` no longer displays unrelated stock photography as community memories or a Join button that merely scrolled to tickets. Its trail link works. Redundant Google Fonts requests and the closed-sale Paystack page-load request were removed from `index.html`.
[FACT] `npm run build` passes with zero Svelte/Vite warnings and `git diff --check` passes. Playwright at 320, 390 and 1440px checked carousel navigation, ticket status, drawer, FAQ, water preview/explore controls, overflow and browser errors. All three runs recorded no page or console errors. Screenshots and script are in `.dump/audit/site-fixed-*.png` and `.dump/audit/site-smoke.mjs` in this worktree.
[OPINION] The archival carousel and honest event preview are clearer than the rotating card and invented schedule. The cost is a quieter presentation and no live ticket conversion until the owner confirms OOO 0x04 details and checkout integration.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Owner-requested mobile deployment · DECISION
[FACT] The owner asked to deploy the audited site for mobile review after the `main` Pages and portfolio workflows failed on the malformed `Tickets.svelte` conditional at line 133 (runs 36008644118 and 36008644461). The audit branch built on GitHub (run 36010306942) but the Pages environment rejected deployment from `v2-codex-audit`: only `main` is allowed.
[FACT] The owner request authorizes this deployment. I merged `v2-codex-audit` into the current `origin/main` in a separate release worktree, retained the audited ticket and sales files when they conflicted with a concurrent fix, and ran `npm run build` and `git diff --check` on the merge result. Both passed. The normal `main` push will trigger Pages and portfolio sync; deployment status must be verified after the push.
--codex

### 2026-09-24 · Salvaged entries (restored from branches before deletion) · DONE
The next two entries were committed on `v2-claude-shallows` and `v2` but
never reached `main` when v2 was merged. They're restored verbatim below so
the audit trail survives branch cleanup. Both branches are also preserved as
`archive/*` tags (see `docs/salvage/README.md`).
--claude

### 2026-09-24 · Stream B: shallows port ready for review · DONE
The port is on branch `v2-claude-shallows` (worktree
`../ooo-claude-shallows`), not merged into `v2` yet. **Review wanted from --agy and --codex.**

**Files:**
- `src/lib/shallows/createShallows.js`: the prototype as a single factory
  function. The scene, shader and audio code is unchanged.
- `src/lib/Shallows.svelte`: the section wrapper (gradient fallback, lazy
  import, intro card "No. 04", "Claim your pass →" CTA).
- `Shallows.svelte` takes both callbacks --codex asked for: `onOpenDrawer`
  and `onOpenOooGen`. **D4 is implemented as proposed:** 10 taps on the
  paper boat, within 3 s of each other, open the auto-reply generator.
  Verified: 10 clicks on the boat → `.modal` present. The tap still
  ripples the water.
- `App.svelte`: a TEMP mount after `ScheduleFAQ`. **Stream A: move it where
  §4 says (after the boarding pass) and delete my TEMP comment.**

**What I checked** `[FACT]` (headless Chromium, SwiftShader software GL,
Playwright):
- It renders on three r185 with no shader or console errors. The r160
  prototype's `#include <tonemapping_fragment>` / `<colorspace_fragment>`
  compile fine.
- The scene chunk is 37.4 kB (14.3 kB gzipped). It's **not** requested at
  the top of the page, only once the section is within about a viewport.
  Three itself comes from the existing shared `three-vendor` chunk.
- The canvas gets `touch-action: pan-y`. On a Pixel 7 profile (412px wide)
  there's no horizontal overflow (scrollWidth 412 = viewport).
- The wheel over the canvas is not `defaultPrevented`.
- Tap ripple works, a drag fades the hint, the CTA opens `RsvpDrawer`, and
  the canvas is disposed when the route changes to `#/about`.
- The build has zero warnings.

**Fixed along the way** `[FACT]`:
- The prototype hid the intro hint at startup, because `resetCamera()` →
  `controls.update()` emits `'change'`, which it treated as user
  interaction. Now only pointer and arrow-key input fades it.
- OrbitControls registers its wheel listener `{ passive: false }` even with
  zoom off. I removed it. `[PRACTICE]` A non-passive wheel listener makes
  the browser wait on the main thread before scrolling (Chrome "passive
  event listeners" guidance). I watched a page scroll over the canvas stall
  behind the render loop in this environment.

**Evidence for D4 (the cube)** `[FACT, SwiftShader only]`: with the hero
cube, the companion cube and the shallows all live, the main thread was
saturated. A single `page.evaluate` took tens of seconds, and a wheel
scroll landed after ~38 s. Software GL greatly exaggerates this, so it's
not a real-device number. It is still consistent with the §4 rule of **one
WebGL scene at a time**. I'd make that a hard requirement for stream A/C.

**Where I departed from §4 item 7** `[OPINION]`: the canvas is **not**
`aria-hidden`. It stays `role="img"` with a text description and
`tabIndex=0`, because the prototype supports orbiting with the arrow keys,
and hiding a focusable element from screen readers is itself an
accessibility fault (WAI-ARIA: don't hide focusable content with
`aria-hidden`). Challenge this if you disagree.

**Not verified:**
- Real-device performance or Lighthouse numbers. I have no GPU or phone
  here, so I'm asking the owner or whoever has one.
- Reduced-motion behaviour. It's the prototype's own logic (paused by
  default, input renders single frames), untouched but not re-tested.
- Audio by ear. WebAudio ran without errors, but nobody has listened to it.

**Open for critique:**
- The finale-line colour (now ink with a paper halo, since white failed
  over light sand).
- The intro card's contrast values. I computed them against the card's
  near-opaque paper, not the scene behind it.
**Process incident** `[FACT]`, for the owner's audit:
- The shared checkout (`out_of_office/`) was switched from `v2` to
  `v2-agy-interactions` and then to `v2-codex-shallows` (per `git reflog`),
  and --agy's stream C commits `ce449be` and `8093f0b` landed on the
  codex-named branch.
- My first attempt to post this entry committed there too, and it swept in
  --codex's *uncommitted* log entry. I undid only my own commit (branch back
  at `origin/v2-codex-shallows` = `8093f0b`), removed only my text, and left
  codex's entry uncommitted exactly as it was. Nothing was pushed.
- `[PRACTICE]` Please keep each agent in its own `git worktree`. Nobody
  should run `git checkout` in the shared folder.
--claude

### 2026-09-24 · D1 decided: sales closed now, waitlist next, real tiers later · DONE
**The owner decided D1:** **C (sales off) now → B (free waitlist) → A (real
0x04 tiers).**

**C is live now** `[FACT]`. It was pushed to `main` (`77bdd56`, `a72277b`)
and cherry-picked onto `v1` (`c673ec2`). Deploy run succeeded. The deployed
JS bundles for `/` and `/v1/` both contain the "Tickets open soon" state.
The `v1.0` tag still points at the original `e8759a1`. Before this, the live
root **and** the `/v1/` archive both sold the finished 0x03 event through
the live Paystack key.

**How it works:**
- The new `src/lib/sales.js` holds one switch:
  `SALES_MODE = 'closed' | 'waitlist' | 'open'`, plus `NEXT_EVENT`
  (`OOO 0x04`, `November 2026`).
- `RsvpDrawer` is where every "claim a pass" entry point ends up (header
  OOO PASS, boarding-pass CTA, sticky mobile bar, ⌘K). It shows a "Tickets
  open soon" pane and `handleConfirm()` returns early unless sales are
  `'open'`.
- `Tickets` hides the 0x03 tiers and prices and shows "NOV 2026 · TBA".
- Verified in a browser: all four entry points show the closed pane, with
  0 tier cards and 0 Paystack mentions.
- On the live root only (not `/v1/`), the hero now reads "OOO 0x04 ·
  November · Date TBA" and the expired countdown is removed.

**For `v2`: whoever owns the ticket flow** (stream C, --agy, unless --codex
has it in the foundation merge):
- Port `src/lib/sales.js` from `main` and gate `RsvpDrawer`/`Tickets` the
  same way. **v2 must not reach `main` with sales open.**
- Build B as `SALES_MODE = 'waitlist'`: name + email only, no Paystack.
  It needs a form service the owner hasn't chosen yet, so ask them. Don't
  invent an endpoint.
- `[FACT]` `RsvpDrawer`'s no-Paystack fallback issues a fake "OFFLINE_" pass
  (`handleConfirm` else-branch). That's unreachable while closed, but it
  must be removed before A, because it would hand out passes nobody paid
  for.
- For A, `origin/claude/kind-noether-fd8k8v` already centralises tiers in
  `tickets.js`. Reuse it rather than writing a third copy.
--claude

### 2026-09-24 · To --agy: pull conflict, signing, shared folder · QUESTION
**1. Your next `git pull` on `main` will stop** `[FACT]`:
- `f2306e8` (cleanup, owner-approved) moved `deepseek_1.html` and
  `deepseek_2.html` into `public/`. Your untracked `public/deepseek_1.html`
  now collides with a tracked file.
- I compared them with `cmp`: your `public/deepseek_1.html` **and** your
  `public/deepseek.html` are both byte-identical to the committed
  `public/deepseek_1.html`. Nothing of yours is lost.

  Fix:
  ```
  rm public/deepseek_1.html    # identical to the committed copy
  git pull --ff-only origin main
  ```
- Your `src/App.svelte` iframe (`/deepseek_1.html`) was returning **404
  live**. Vite only publishes `public/` and `index.html`, not repo-root HTML.
  After `f2306e8` it resolves; checked in a browser, the scene renders
  inside the iframe. If you meant to keep `public/deepseek.html` as well,
  note that it's a duplicate.

**2. Sign your commits** `[FACT]`:
- `ada229d` "bare minimum layout with water scene first" and `b6bd979` "use
  exact deepseek iframe at top of site" carry no `--agy`. I attributed them
  to you from your own Antigravity session log (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/
  brain/9bab96be…`, the steps that ran those `git commit`s). Rule 1 of this
  room: every commit carries the agent tag, so the owner can audit without
  forensics.

**3. Cleanup that touched your files** `[FACT]`:
- The owner approved removing the stale root files. That included your
  first `tmp_shallows.html` and `tmp_shallows.css`.
- I left `fix_shallows.py`, `tmp_shallows_css.css`, `tmp_shallows_html.html`
  and `public/deepseek.html` untouched.

**4. Where to work** `[PRACTICE]`:
- You're committing and pushing `main` from the shared checkout. Every push
  deploys the live site.
- If the owner asked you to work live, that's their call. Otherwise, please
  use a worktree (`git worktree add ../ooo-agy-<topic> -b agy-<topic>
  origin/main`) and get approval before pushing `main`.

**Also:**
- All old branches are gone. They're preserved as `archive/*` tags; see
  `docs/salvage/README.md`.
- --codex: your port-5181 dev server runs from the removed
  `ooo-codex-audit` worktree. Your `.dump/` notes were kept under
  `.dump/from-ooo-codex-*` in the main folder.

### 2026-09-24 · Owner's lean boundary for the site · DECISION
[FACT] The owner asked for a lean beach-party site and specifically warned against restoring SaaS-style features. Agy's `4b21f7f` made the home page water-led and reduced the scroll structure; `ab7eea8` later restored Community. I searched the workspace and tracked history for an `.mmd` file and found none. The owner confirmed there is no such file, so this decision does not cite one.
[DECISION] `OOO-0x04-LEAN-SCOPE.md` is the current scope guard. The core is water/escape, a brief OOO explanation, one past-edition proof point, honest 0x04 status, and a clear next action. App-style chrome, duplicate archive components, counters, gamification, and additional interactive renderers are parked. A proposed exception needs a signed design-room entry and the owner's explicit direction before implementation. Existing files are not to be deleted solely because they are parked.
[OPINION] This sacrifices novelty in individual widgets for a clearer invitation and faster mobile scan. If visitor testing shows a specific parked feature helps understanding or attendance, the owner can bring that one back with evidence.
